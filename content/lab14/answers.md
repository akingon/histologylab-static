						<h3>#56 Testis and Epididymis, Human, Adult, <span class="caps">H&amp;E</span></h3>

<p>Why are the Leydig cells eosinophilic? <br>
<em>They contain numerous mitochondria.</em></p>

<h2>Questions</h2>


<ol>
<li>What is the difference between spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis?    <em>Spermatogenesis is the entire process of formation of sperm from stem cell to spermatozoan.  Spermiogenesis is the maturation process from spermatid to spermatozoan.</em> </li>
<li>What is the effect of castration on the accessory sex glands (prostate and seminal vesicles)?  <em>Atrophy.</em></li>
<li>Where is the primary source of testosterone? <em>The Leydig cells.</em></li>
<li>Where is the principal site of storage and mobility acquisition of spermatozoa in the male reproductive system? <em>Epididymis.</em></li>
<li>Follow the passage of spermatozoa from the seminiferous tubules of the testis up to ejaculation.  <em>Seminiferous tubules, tubuli recti, rete testis, ductuli efferentes, epididymis, ductus deferens, urethra.</em></li>
<li>Which organs are the major sources of seminal fluid? <em>Seminal vesicle, prostate gland, bulbo-urethral.</em></li>
<li>What are the components of the blood-testis barrier and what is its significance?  <em>Tight junctions between Sertoli cells isolate developing sperm from the vasculature (prevent their immunological rejection).</em></li>
