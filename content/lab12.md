<p>The urinary system consists of the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and the urethra. The kidney is specialized for the removal of waste products from the blood and for the regulation of water and salt balance of the blood and intercellular fluids.</p>

<p>The kidney is divided into <i>lobes</i>. One lobe consists of the conical <u>medullary pyramid</u> and the cortical substance that surrounds it like a cap. This slide demonstrates a unilobar kidney. The human kidney is composed of 12-13 lobes.</p>
