						<p>Be sure you know the biochemical composition of the cytoplasmic granules of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes), eosinophils, and basophils.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>


<ol>
<li>What is the functional significance of the cytoplasmic staining affinities of the basophilic erythroblast, polychromatophilic erythroblast, normoblast and erythrocyte?  <br>
<em>Basophilic erythroblast - ribosomes predominate for production of hemoglobin and transferrin receptors.</em>  <br>
<em>Polychromatophilic erythroblast - hemoglobin synthesis beginning.</em>  <br>
<em>Normoblast - hemoglobin fills cytoplasm, pyknotic nucleus.</em>  <br>
<em>Erythrocyte - anuclear cell, hemoglobin fills cytoplasm.</em></li>
<li>Is the nucleus more intensely basophilic in an erythroblast or a normoblast?  Normoblast  What is the significance of these nuclear changes?  <em>Erythroblasts are cells in which <span class="caps">DNA </span>is transcribed; the chromatin is no longer active in the normoblast.</em></li>
<li>What is the origin of platelets?  <em>Megakaryocyte</em></li>
</ol>
