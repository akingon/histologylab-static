<h2>Learning objectives</h2>

<ul>
<li>Understand the structure of the heart and its conducting system.</li>
<li>Know the components of the vascular wall and how these differ among the types of blood vessels.</li>
</ul>

<p>The cardiovascular system is composed of the <u>heart</u> and a continuous system of <u>blood vessels</u> including arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins. Together the lymphatic vessels and the cardiovascular system form the <u>circulatory system</u>.</p>

<p>Each component of the cardiovascular system is comprised of three layers referred to as tunics. The innermost layer is the <u>tunica</u> intima, which includes a single layer of cells lining the lumen called the endothelium. The middle layer is known as the <u>tunica media</u>, and the outermost layer is the <u>tunica adventitia</u>. There are important histological differences in the composition of these layers within each component of this system, which will be explored later in this lab.  </p>
