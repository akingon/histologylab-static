<h2>Learning objectives</h2>
<p>1. Know how the fundamental organization of the GI tract is modified along its course from the esophagus through large intestine.</p>
<p>2. Know the cell types in the mucosa of the GI tract and their function. </p>
<p>The digestive system consists of the oral cavity, the pharynx, the alimentary tract (canal), and the anal canal. There are both intrinsic and extrinsic glands, which may secrete digestive enzymes or mucus to facilitate the digestion and transport of ingested food.  The intrinsic glands lie within the mucosa or submucosa of their organ of origin. The extrinsic glands communicate with their organ of origin through ducts. The extrinsic digestive glands are the <u>major salivary glands</u> including the parotid, sublingual and submandibular (submaxillary) glands; the <u>pancreas</u>; and the <u>liver</u>.  These glands will be discussed in the following lab.</p>

<p>Organs of the digestive tract typically have 4 concentric coats. Proceeding outward from the lumen these are: (1) the mucosa  (<u>mucous membrane</u>), (2) the <u>submucosa</u>, (3) the <u>muscularis</u> (muscularis externa), and (4) the <u>adventitia</u> or <u>serosa</u>.  (Refer to diagram below).</p>

<p>1. The <u>mucosa</u> has three components: (a) the <u>epithelium</u> and its underlying basement membrane; (b) a thin underlying layer of loose, cellular connective tissue, the <u>lamina propria</u>; and Â© a relatively thin layer of smooth muscle, the <u>muscularis mucosae</u>. The latter may consist of both circular and longitudinally arranged layers.</p>

<p>2. The <u>submucosa</u> is composed of a layer of dense, irregularly arranged connective tissue that contains nervous tissue (the submucosal plexus of Meissner), as well as blood vessels.</p>

<p>3. The <u>muscularis externa</u> consists of at least 2 layers of smooth muscle; an inner circular and outer <u>longitudinal</u> layer.  Connective tissue, separating the muscle layers, contains nerves (myenteric plexus of Auerbach) and blood vessels.</p>

<p>4. The outermost layer of <u>adventitia</u> consists of a thin layer of loose connective tissue; where the digestive system is covered by peritoneum the adventitial layer is called the serosa.</p>
