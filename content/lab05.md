<h2>Learning objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Know the components of tissue in the central and peripheral nervous systems.</li>
<li>Understand the meaning of terms gray matter and white matter.</li>
<li>Relate nerve function to the properties of neurons and their cell processes:  axons and dendrites.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The central nervous system (CNS) includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>nerve cells (<u>neuronal cell bodies</u>) and their <u>dendrites</u> and <u>axons</u> (both myelinated and unmyelinated),</li>
<li>supporting cells, (the <u>neuroglia):</u>  <u>oligodendroglia</u>, <u>astrocytes</u> and <u>microglia</u></li>
<li>meninges: <u>dura, arachnoid, and pia,</u></li>
<li>blood vessels.</li>
</ol>

<p>The peripheral nervous system (PNS) contains:</p>
<ol>
<li>neurons (organized into clusters called <u>ganglia</u>),  </li>
<li>supporting cells including <u>satellite cells</u> associated with the ganglionic neurons and <u>schwann cells</u> which form the myelin sheath</li>
<li>connective tissue elements (endoneurium, perineurium and epineurium)</li>
<li>blood vessels.</li>
</ol>



<p>The neuron is the structural and functional unit of the nervous system.  Neurons are highly polarized cells.  The cell body contains the nucleus and synthetic apparatus.  The highly branched <u>dendrites</u> are the receptive pole and <u>axons</u> are the transmitting pole. Nervous tissue is characterized by its extreme specialization for excitability and conductivity.</p>

<p>The supporting cells are in intimate contact with the neurons and their processes in both the <span class="caps">CNS </span>and the <span class="caps">PNS. </span> These cells provide structural support and nutrients to the neurons. There are also macrophages present in the nervous system; these cells are called microglia in the <span class="caps">CNS. </span></p>

<p>The connective tissue elements include the <u>meninges,</u> which surround the central nervous system; capsules surround some sense organs and ganglia; and the <u>endo-, peri-, and epineurium</u> of peripheral nerves.</p>

<p>The detailed structure and function of the nervous system will be studied during the neurosciences course.  The following class slides and electron micrographs will serve to acquaint you with nervous tissue as one of the four basic tissues.  </p>
