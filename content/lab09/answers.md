<h3>#17 Heart, Sagittal Section (Mallory-Azan)</h3>

<p>Is the myocardium thicker in the atrium or ventricle?  Why?   The myocardium is thicker in the ventricle.  The ventricle must create more force when contracting to deliver blood to the lungs (right ventricle) or the entire body (left ventricle), whereas the atrium only has to deliver blood to the ventricle. </p>
