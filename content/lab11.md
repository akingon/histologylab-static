<h2>Learning objectives</h2>

<p>1. Recognize major parts of the respiratory track: trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles, alveolar duct, and alveoli.</p>

<p>2. Understand the blood-air interface in the alveolus and know the function of the type I and II pneumocyte and alveolar macrophage.</p>

<p>The respiratory system functions in the exchange of gases between the external and internal environments.  Major parts of the system include the <u>nasal cavity, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and pulmonary alveoli</u>.  Some regions of the respiratory system are specialized for conduction of gases and other areas function primarily in the exchange of gases.  Filtration mechanisms exist in both regions.  The function of each part of the respiratory system is reflected in the structure of its wall: the type of epithelium and its apical modifications, intraepithelial and subepithelial glands, cartilaginous rings and plates, smooth muscle and elastic tissue, and the relationship of capillary endothelium to alveolar epithelium.</p>
