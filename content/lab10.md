						<h2>Learning objectives</h2>

<p>1. Know the layers of the skin.</p>

<p>2. Understand how the components of the skin serve its various functions.</p>

<p>This laboratory exercise serves both as an introduction to the skin, the largest organ of the body, and as a review of the major tissues.  As you study the slides of the skin, identify examples of epithelium, connective tissue, muscle and nerve.</p>

<p>The majority of skin is thin skin, most of which is hairy.  Thick skin is restricted to the ventral surface of the hands and feet.  All skin is made up of three layers:</p>


<ol>
<li><u><b>Epidermis</b></u>- stratified squamous keratinizing epithelium</li>
<li><u><b>Dermis</b></u> - a superficial papilllary layer of loose connective tissue, underlain by a reticular layer of dense fibrous irregularly arranged connective tissue</li>
<li><u><b>Hypodermis</b></u> - deepest layer of skin, also called subcutaneous tissue, loose connective tissue, containing adipose tissue</li>
</ol>
