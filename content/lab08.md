<h2>Components of the Lymphatic System</h2>

<p>The lymphoid system has <u>primary</u> lymphoid organs that produce lymphocytes and <u>secondary</u> lymphoid organs, which are the sites of immune response.</p>

<p>Primary lymphoid organs include <u>bone marrow</u> and <u>thymus</u> (encapsulated). All lymphocytes originate in the bone marrow. B cells (as well as monocytes, erythrocytes, granulocytes, and megakaryoctyes) remain in the bone marrow as they mature. T cells migrate to the thymus before maturation.    </p>

<p>Secondary lymphoid organs include <u>tonsil</u>, <u>lymph nodes</u>, <u>spleen</u>, and <u>diffuse lymphoid tissue</u> (bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue or <span class="caps">BALT </span>in the lungs and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue or <span class="caps">MALT </span>in the digestive tract).<br>
<br>
<u>Lymphatic vessels</u> carry lymph fluid, which contains particulate matter, and protein that escape from blood capillaries as well as ingested fats, microorganisms, and other antigenic material that penetrate epithelial surfaces. Lymph is filtered in lymph nodes and then returned to the circulation via the thoracic duct and the right lymphatic duct.</p>
